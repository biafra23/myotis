# devp2p Playground

A from-scratch Ethereum devp2p implementation in Java 21. Connects to the Ethereum mainnet (or testnets) using the devp2p protocol stack: discv4 peer discovery, RLPx encrypted transport, and eth/67-69 sub-protocol. Includes a beacon chain light client for consensus-layer state root verification and snap/1 support for account and storage lookups with Merkle proofs and cryptographic verification back to beacon chain finality.

## Requirements

- Java 21+
- Gradle (wrapper included)

## Build

```bash
# Build all modules (includes tests)
./gradlew build

# Compile only (skip tests)
./gradlew compileJava

# Run tests
./gradlew test
```

## Run

The application operates in two modes: **daemon** and **client**. The daemon discovers peers, maintains connections, and listens for commands on a Unix domain socket (`/tmp/ethp2p.sock`). The client sends a single command to the running daemon and exits.

### Start the daemon

```bash
# Mainnet (default)
./gradlew :app:run

# Testnet
./gradlew :app:run -Pnetwork=sepolia
./gradlew :app:run -Pnetwork=holesky

# Custom port (default: 30303)
./gradlew :app:run -Pport=30304
```

The daemon runs in the foreground. It discovers peers via discv4 (Kademlia DHT), establishes RLPx encrypted connections, and performs eth protocol handshakes. A beacon chain light client syncs finalized state roots from the consensus layer.

### Stop the daemon

```bash
./gradlew :app:run -Pargs=stop
```

## Query commands

All commands are sent to the running daemon via IPC. Responses are JSON.

```

Returns account data with a Merkle-Patricia proof and cryptographic verification.

**Account fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `exists` | boolean | Whether the account was found in the state trie |
| `address` | string | The queried address (0x-prefixed) |
| `accountHash` | string | keccak256 of the address |
| `nonce` | long | Account transaction count (only if `exists=true`) |
| `balance` | string | Account balance in wei (only if `exists=true`) |
| `storageRoot` | string | Storage trie root hash (only if `exists=true`) |
| `codeHash` | string | Contract code hash (only if `exists=true`) |
| `proof` | array | Merkle-Patricia trie proof nodes (RLP-encoded, hex) |

**Verification fields** (in the `verification` object):

| Field | Type | Values | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `peerProofValid` | boolean | `true` / `false` | Whether the Merkle proof is cryptographically valid against the peer's state root. Proves the data is authentic relative to the peer's claimed state, but does not prove the state root itself is canonical. |
| `peerStateRoot` | string | 0x-prefixed hex | The state root the peer provided, against which the proof was verified. |
| `beaconSynced` | boolean | `true` / `false` | Whether the beacon chain light client has synced (has a finalized state root). |
| `beaconChainVerified` | boolean | `true` / `false` | Whether the peer's state root is verified against the beacon chain. This is the critical trust anchor: `true` means the data is cryptographically backed by sync committee signatures. |
| `verifyMethod` | string | `"stateRootMatch"` / `"headerChain"` | How the beacon chain verification was achieved (only present when `beaconChainVerified=true`). See below. |
| `matchedBeaconSlot` | long | slot number | The beacon slot used as the trust anchor (only present when `beaconChainVerified=true`). Beacon slots increment every 12 seconds. |
| `blsVerified` | boolean | `true` / `false` | Whether the trust anchor slot was validated via BLS sync committee signatures (only present when `beaconChainVerified=true`). `true` means at least 2/3 of the sync committee signed off on the data. |

**`verifyMethod` values:**

- **`stateRootMatch`** -- The peer's state root exactly matches a state root from a recent beacon block header stored in the rolling window cache. This is the most direct verification path.
- **`headerChain`** -- The peer's block is ahead of the finalized beacon block, so a chain of consecutive block headers was fetched and verified from the beacon-finalized block to the peer's block. Verification checks: (1) the first header's state root matches the beacon-attested root, (2) each header's parent hash matches the previous header's hash, (3) the last header's state root matches the peer's root.

### Get storage

```bash
# Direct slot access
./gradlew :app:run -Pargs="get-storage 0x<contract> <slot>"

# ERC-20 balance lookup (mapping slot with holder address)
./gradlew :app:run -Pargs="get-storage 0x<token> <slot> 0x<holder>"
```

Returns storage slot data for a contract with Merkle-Patricia proof verification. For ERC-20 tokens, pass the mapping slot number and holder address to compute `keccak256(abi.encode(holder, slot))`.

**Storage fields:**

|-------|------|-------------|
| `storageProofValid` | boolean | Whether the storage proof is valid against the account's storage root |
| `beaconSynced` | boolean | Whether the beacon light client has synced |
| `beaconChainVerified` | boolean | Whether the state is verified against the beacon chain (same logic as `get-account`) |
| `verifyMethod` | string | `"stateRootMatch"` or `"headerChain"` (same as `get-account`, only present when `beaconChainVerified=true`) |
| `matchedBeaconSlot` | long | Beacon slot trust anchor (only present when `beaconChainVerified=true`) |
| `blsVerified` | boolean | Whether the trust anchor has BLS verification (only present when `beaconChainVerified=true`) |

### Dial a specific peer

```bash
./gradlew :app:run -Pargs="dial enode://..."
```

## Helper scripts

Convenience scripts that wrap the Gradle commands and format the output with `jq`:

### `peers.sh`

Lists connected peers in READY state, sorted by snap support and client ID:

```bash
./peers.sh
# Output:
# 1.2.3.4:30303 snap=true Geth/v1.15.0/linux-amd64/go1.23.4
# 5.6.7.8:30303 snap=true Nethermind/v1.30.0/...
```

### `status.sh`

Prints daemon status as JSON:

```bash
./status.sh
# {"ok":true,"state":"RUNNING","uptimeSeconds":120,"discoveredPeers":214,...}
```

### `beacon-status.sh`

Prints beacon light client sync status:

```bash
./beacon-status.sh
```

## Beacon chain light client

The daemon includes a consensus-layer light client that tracks finalized state roots from the beacon chain. This enables trustless verification of account and storage proofs against the canonical chain state.

### Trust model

The only trust anchors are **sync committee BLS signatures** and the embedded historical hash accumulators. All data from devp2p and libp2p peers is cryptographically verified -- no trusted third-party RPCs or HTTP APIs are used in production.

### Verification flow

1. The beacon light client obtains a finalized execution state root (BLS-verified via sync committee signatures)
2. When a snap query returns account/storage data with a Merkle proof, the proof is first verified against the peer's state root
3. The peer's state root is then linked to the beacon-finalized state root via one of:
   - **Direct match** -- the peer's state root matches a known beacon-attested root
   - **Header chain verification** -- block headers are fetched in batches from the beacon-finalized block to the peer's block, verifying: (a) the first header's state root matches the beacon root, (b) consecutive parent hash chain integrity, (c) the last header's state root matches the peer's root

### Sync modes

The light client can sync from:
- **Beacon chain P2P network** (libp2p) -- fully decentralized, uses BLS-verified bootstrap and finality updates
- **Beacon node HTTP API** (seeded mode) -- seeds initial state from a local beacon node (e.g. Lighthouse on `http://localhost:5052`), then continues via P2P

Helper scripts for running a local beacon node are in `scripts/`:
- `scripts/lighthouse.sh` -- starts Lighthouse via Docker with checkpoint sync
- `scripts/lodestar.sh` -- starts Lodestar via Docker with checkpoint sync

## Architecture

Three Gradle modules:

- **core** -- cryptographic identity (`NodeKey`), data types (`BlockHeader`), ENR decoding
- **networking** -- protocol layers, all Netty-based:
  - `discv4` -- UDP peer discovery (ping/pong/findnode/neighbors)
  - `rlpx` -- TCP transport with EIP-8 ECIES handshake and AES-256-CTR framed channel
  - `eth` -- eth/67-69 sub-protocol (hello, status, block headers/bodies)
  - `snap` -- snap/1 sub-protocol (account range, storage range queries with Merkle proofs)
- **consensus** -- beacon chain light client (sync committee BLS verification), Merkle-Patricia proof verification
- **app** -- daemon/CLI entry point, Unix domain socket IPC server, peer caching

### Protocol flow

```
DiscV4Service (UDP)
  discovers peers
    --> RLPxConnector.connect() (TCP)
      --> ECIES handshake (HANDSHAKE_WRITE -> HANDSHAKE_READ -> FRAMED)
        --> EthHandler (AWAITING_HELLO -> AWAITING_STATUS -> READY)
          --> block headers, account/storage queries available
```

### Key dependencies

- **Tuweni 2.7.2** -- RLP encoding, SECP256K1, byte utilities
- **Netty 4.2.x** -- NIO transport
- **BouncyCastle** -- SECP256K1 crypto provider
- **jvm-libp2p** -- beacon chain P2P networking (consensus module)
